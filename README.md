Line Battle Game

This project is a turn-based war game where the player faces off against an AI opponent on a 21-tile battlefield. Each side controls a troop of soldiers and must strategically advance, retreat, attack, or use bombs to defeat the opponent. The game emphasizes the use of various data types, control structures (if, while), and modular programming practices.

Key features include:

* A dynamic battlefield with movement, attacks, and bomb placement.
* Scouting mechanics that provide intel on enemy positions.
* Victory conditions based on either eliminating the enemy or successfully detonating a bomb in the enemy's camp.
